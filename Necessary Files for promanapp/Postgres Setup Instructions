POSTGRESQL SETUP :

1. Install Postgres using setup(download it from official site of postgres)

2. Testing the install and working :
	
	i. Open SQL Shell(Start Menu --> Postgres 10---> SQL Shell)
			You should see something like Server[localhost] :
		a. Press enter a couple of times to connect to localhost at port 5432 with 
			database postgres and user postgres(you may have to type in the password)
		SUCCESS : when you see postgres=#(where postgres is the database name)
		
		*****WHAT IF WE FAILED ??????*****(THE ERRORS)

		FAILURE 1 : chcp is not an internal or external command
			SOLUTION : Path variables are to be set
						In PATH variable add following three values :
						a. Path to the Postgres bin folder
							example : C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\10\bin
						b. Path to the system root : %SystemRoot%
						c. Path to the system32 folder : %SystemRoot%\system32
							(NOTE : The slash is back slash and its kinda important)
		FAILURE 2 : Is the server running and listening on port 5432?					SOLUTION : We need to start the server
							i. Press Window_Key+R to open run
							ii. Type "cmd" and press enter
							iii. In that enter "pg_ctl start"
							iv. This should start the server
				WHAT IF IT DIDN'T?
					SUB-FAILURE 1 : Database cluster is not initialized(or something like that)
						SOLUTION : Set PGDATA environment variable 
										i. Create a new folder anywhere
										ii. Copy the path of that folder and paste  	it in PGDATA value part
										iii. got to that folder again and in address bar(from where you copied the path) clear everything and type "cmd"
										iv. This opens the command prompt window
										v. Type "pg_ctl initdb" 
										vi. This makes your new folder a database cluster
					NOW OPEN ANOTHER CMD AND TRY STARTING THE SERVER AGAIN
		
		FAILURE 3 : After solving above failures we try to reconnect from SQL Shell
					(Pressing enter 4-5 times)
					But you get FATAL : Role postgres doesn't exist
				SOLUTION 1: i.close sql shell and the cmd after pressing Ctrl+C in cmd(basically stopping the server)
							ii. Open another cmd and type in the following
								"createuser -s -U (Username of you system) -P postgres"
								i. it will ask for password twice and will create a super user postgres with given password
				SOLUTION 2 : i. Open pgAdmin 4
							 ii. Create a new Server by right clicking on Server(left side)
							 iii. Provide Server name, host (=localhost), username (= username of your PC), password(= leave empty)
							 iv. Click save
							 v. Open the server
							 vi. Right click on Login/Group Roles and create a new Role
							 	i. Provide name, password, and in privileges tab set every option to yes
				---------Done-------------
				Try Reconnecting with the postgres user by pressing enter and it should connect now and you will see postgres=#
				Then go to pgAdmin....delete the server you made with local machine user and re-create a server with user postgres in pgAdmin
